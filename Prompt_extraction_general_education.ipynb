The lower the income, the less likely the applicant can repay the loan, which increases the risk for the lender. In this case, the applicant's income was not high enough to assure the lender of their ability to repay the loan.\\n\\nThe second most important factor was the amount of loan requested.

The applicant requested a substantial loan, which may have been deemed too risky by the lender given the applicant's income level.\\n\\nLastly, the applicant's history of loan defaults also negatively impacted the decision. A loan default means the borrower failed to repay a loan as agreed. This history suggests that the applicant might not be reliable in making loan repayments.\\n\\nIn summary, the applicant's low annual income, high loan request, and history of loan defaults were the main reasons for the loan denial.

This decision was primarily influenced by three factors: the interest rate, the applicant's annual income, and the length of their credit history. \\n\\nThe interest rate on the loan was a significant factor in the decision. A higher interest rate can make a loan more difficult to repay, which can increase the risk of default. In this case, the interest rate was high enough to negatively impact the loan approval.\\n\\nThe applicant's annual income, however, had a positive effect on the decision. Higher income can make it easier to repay a loan, which reduces the risk for the lender. Unfortunately, in this case, the income level was not high enough to offset the high interest rate.\\n\\nFinally, the length of the applicant's credit history also played a role. A longer credit history can provide more evidence of responsible borrowing, which can increase the chances of loan approval. However, the credit history length in this case was not sufficient to sway the decision in favor of approval.\\n\\nIn summary, while the applicant's annual income and credit history length were positive factors, the high interest rate was a significant negative factor that led to the denial of the loan application.\",\n          \"The AI model predicted that the applicant's loan application would be denied. The three most influential factors in this decision were the applicant's annual income, the interest rate on the loan, and their monthly debt payments. \\n\\nThe applicant's annual income was the most significant factor. The lower the income, the less likely someone is to be able to repay a loan, which increases the risk for the lender. In this case, the applicant's income was low enough to negatively impact the likelihood of loan approval.\\n\\nThe interest rate on the loan was the second most important factor. A higher interest rate means the borrower has to pay back more money over time. The model found that the interest rate for this loan was high enough to increase the probability of the loan being approved, possibly because a higher interest rate could compensate for the risk associated with a lower-income borrower.\\n\\nThe third factor was the applicant's monthly debt payments. If a person already has high monthly debt payments, they might struggle to make additional loan payments. In this case, the applicant's monthly debt payments were high enough to slightly increase the likelihood of the loan being approved, perhaps because the model considered the applicant's ability to manage debt.\\n\\nIn summary, the loan application was denied primarily due to the applicant's low annual income, despite the potentially compensating factors of a high interest rate and the applicant's history of managing monthly debt payments.\",\n          \"The AI model predicted that the loan application of the individual would be denied, and this decision was primarily influenced by three factors: the applicant's annual income, the requested loan amount, and the applied interest rate. \\n\\nThe applicant's annual income was the most significant factor that negatively impacted the loan approval. This suggests that the income level was deemed insufficient to comfortably service the loan, considering the applicant's other financial obligations. \\n\\nThe second most influential factor was the loan amount requested. The model found this to be a negative contributor, indicating that the requested amount was considered too high relative to the applicant's financial capacity. This could be due to the income level or other existing financial commitments.\\n\\nLastly, the applied interest rate also negatively influenced the decision. This suggests that the rate might be too high for the applicant to manage, considering their income and the loan amount. \\n\\nIn summary, the model denied the loan application primarily due to concerns about the applicant's ability to manage the loan repayment, given their income level, the requested loan amount, and the applied interest rate.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"fre_score\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 17.27485471141284,\n        \"min\": 20.868146853146868,\n        \"max\": 81.73973443223443,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 30,\n        \"samples\": [\n          49.32628205128208,\n          46.53112258953169,\n          30.40322404371588\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"education\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"High School\",\n          \"Master\",\n          \"Bachelor\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":44}]}]}
